<h1 align="center"> *FIRST JAVA PROGRAM* </h1>

> Everything in java is inside class.
Every file that ends with .java is a class itself.
> Whatever variable we see in programming languages if it starts with capital letter means that is class.
> If the file name is for ex-Main.java the Main class will be "public" class.
> After successfully compilation of .java file will get a .class file and not directly it converted to machine code. That .class file is machine independent.
