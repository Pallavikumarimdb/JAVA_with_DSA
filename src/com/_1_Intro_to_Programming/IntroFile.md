<h1 align="center"> *INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING* </h1>

## Programming:-
> It is a way to instruct the computer to perform various task.
Computers only understands Binary i.e., 0’s and 1’s. <br> 
> Instructing computers in Binary i.e. 0’s and 1’s are very difficult for humans so,
to solve this issue we have programming languages.

## Programming language:-
>It is a computer language used by programmers to communicate with computers. <br/>

## Types of Programming Languages-
### 1. Procedural:- 
>  Specifies a series of well-structured steps and procedures to compose a
program. <br/>
 Contains a systematic order of statements functions and commands to
complete a task.
### Functional:-
>  Writing a program only in pure functions i.e., never modify variables but
only create new ones as an output. <br/>
 Used in a situation where we have to perform lots of different
operations on the same set of data like ML.
### Object Oriented:-
>  Revolves around objects. <br/>
 Code + Data = objects <br/>
 Developed to make it easier to develop, debug, reuse and maintain
software.
### Note:- 
>“One programming language can be of all 3 types like- Python” <br/> > Java Follows procedural and object oriented both types
## Static VS Dynamic Languages :-
### Static:
>  Perform type checking at compile time <br/>
>  Errors will show at compile time <br/>
>  Declare datatypes before use <br/>
>  More control <br/>
### Dynamic: 
>  Perform type checking at runtime <br/>
>  Error might not show till programs run <br/>
>  No need to declare datatype of variables <br/>
>  Saves time in writing code but might give error at runtime. <br/>
## * Memory Management *
###  There are 2 types of memory Stack and Heap 
> When we declare a variable then the reference variable stored in stack
memory points to the object of that variable stored in heap memory. <br/>
For ex:- 𝑎 = 10 <br/>
Here “a” is called reference variable, and “10” is the object of That reference
variable <br/>
 Reference variable are stored in stack memory. <br/>
 Heap memory stores the objects of reference variable. <br/>
## Points to remember:-
>  More than one reference variable can points to the same object. <br/>
 If any changes made to the object of any reference variable that will be
reflected to all others variable pointing to same object. <br/>
 If there is an object without reference variable then object will be
destroyed by “Garbage Collection”
