> Heap is the runtime data area from which the memory for all the classes instances is allocated.
> Arrays in C and C++ use contiguous memory allocation in order that pointer arithmetic can be used to access the various elements.
> Even though definition of Arrays says (It's continuous) still in Java internally it may not be continuous. -- It depends on JVM.
> By default value in arrays : int -> 0, String -> "null"
> "null" is a special type of literal of a null type.
> By Default value of object is "null".
> Primitives are stored in stack memory and objects in heap.
> How reference variables are passed into function? Ans:- In java only "Call by value"
> When we pass object reference, in actually going to take copy of that reference which is going to point to the same object.
> Strings are immutable in java but Arrays are mutable in java.
> Mutable means you can change the object.
